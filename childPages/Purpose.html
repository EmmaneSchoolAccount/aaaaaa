        <p>This repository's sole purpose is to only be made for a school assignment. The repository is made unprofessionally, and so information coming from here should be perceived with a grain of salt to you reading as to not be convinced of a fake lie if I had spread one as well inside one of the subject of interest I called upon to.</p>
